# MakeUofTProject-1
Team Buzzer's Project

A project by @zarak3268, @jennchenn, @harris222, and Lincoln Leung at the MakeUoft Hackathon, which happened at 
Myhal Innovation Centre, Toronto, Ontario from February 16th to the 17th. Our team set up a breadboard wired by circuits consisting of a LED light, a piezoelectric buzzer, and an ultrasonic sensor. Based off the components of the breadboard, we built an arduino program that detects distance from an ultrasonic sensor to an object adjacent to it. Using that distance, we modified the pitch of the buzzer and the brightness of the LED light. We also connected our project with a raspberry pi, so that the power of the breadboard could be controlled by a phone through wifi-connection with the pi. 

In the following link, you can find a short video demonstration of our project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iCzFXyMosc

The ability of controlling our project's power-state using a phone's wireless connection, unfortunately, is not shown in the demonstration.
